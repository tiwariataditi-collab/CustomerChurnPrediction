# CustomerChurnPrediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company’s services. By identifying patterns in customer behavior, businesses can take proactive steps to improve retention. 

🧰 Technologies Used
  Python
  Pandas, NumPy
  Matplotlib, Seaborn
  Scikit-learn

📂 Dataset
  Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset
  Target Variable: Churn (Yes / No)
  Features include:
  Demographics (gender, senior citizen, partner, dependents)
  Services (internet, phone, streaming, security, backup)
  Account information (contract type, payment method, charges)

🔍 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading
  Imported necessary libraries
  Loaded the dataset using pandas.read_csv()
  Displayed first and last rows to understand the structure

2️⃣ Data Exploration
  Checked dataset shape and column data types
  Used info() and describe() for statistical insights
  Analyzed churn distribution

3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  Converted TotalCharges column to numeric
  Handled missing values using median imputation
  Replaced inconsistent categorical values (e.g., "No phone service" → "No")
  Dropped unnecessary column (customerID)

4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Visualized churn distribution
  Used pair plots, count plots, and box plots
  Analyzed relationships between churn and:
  Contract type
  Internet service
  Monthly & total charges

5️⃣ Feature Encoding
  Converted binary categorical columns into numerical form
  Applied One-Hot Encoding to multi-class categorical features like PaymentMethod
  Ensured all features were model-ready

6️⃣ Feature Scaling
  Applied StandardScaler to normalize numerical features
  Improved model performance and stability

7️⃣ Train-Test Split
  Split data into 80% training and 20% testing
  Ensured balanced evaluation of the model

8️⃣ Model Building
  Used Random Forest Classifier
  Configured with:
  n_estimators = 100
  random_state = 42
  Trained the model on the training dataset

9️⃣ Model Evaluation
  Generated predictions on test data
  Evaluated using:
  Accuracy Score
  Classification metrics
  Displayed results using a custom evaluation function

🔟 Feature Importance
  Analyzed which features contributed most to churn prediction
  Visualized feature importance using bar plots
  Key influencing factors included:
  Contract type
  Monthly charges
  Internet service
  Payment method

✅ Results
  The Random Forest model achieved strong predictive performance
  Successfully identified key churn drivers
  Demonstrated how machine learning can help businesses reduce customer attrition

🔁 Postdictive Analysis (Predicted vs Actual Churn)
Postdictive analysis evaluates how well the model’s predictions match actual customer churn outcomes and helps understand both strengths and weaknesses of the model.

📌 Predicted Churn vs Actual Churn
 ~The model correctly identified a large proportion of non-churn customers, showing strong performance in recognizing loyal users.
 ~It also successfully detected many high-risk churn customers, especially those with short tenure and month-to-month contracts.
 ~Some churn cases were misclassified, particularly where customer behavior was less consistent.

✅ Where the Model Performed Well

The model performed strongly in the following areas:
Long-term contract customers
→ Accurately predicted low churn due to stable customer behavior

Customers with high monthly charges + short tenure
→ Correctly flagged as high churn risk.

Clear behavioral patterns
→ Customers using electronic check payments and fiber-optic internet were predicted accurately.

Non-churn prediction
→ The model showed high reliability in predicting customers who are likely to stay.

❌ Where the Model Failed & Why
Despite good performance, the model had some limitations:

~False Negatives (Actual churn but predicted as non-churn)
  ~Customers who churned suddenly due to reasons not captured in data (e.g., service issues, competition offers).
  ~Long-tenure customers who unexpectedly left.

~False Positives (Predicted churn but actually stayed)
  ~Price-sensitive customers who were flagged but remained due to discounts or loyalty benefits.
  ~Customers with mixed signals (high charges but strong service usage).

~Reasons for failure:
 ~Lack of qualitative data (customer satisfaction, complaints, network quality).
 ~External factors not included in the dataset (market competition, regional issues).
 ~Class imbalance between churn and non-churn customers.

💼 Business Recommendations---
🎯 Actions to Reduce Customer Churn---
  1. Promote Long-Term Contracts
     Offer discounts or perks for customers switching from month-to-month to annual contracts.
  2. Target High-Charge Customers 
    Provide personalized pricing plans or loyalty discounts for customers with high monthly charges.
  3.Improve Fiber-Optic Service Experience
    Investigate service quality issues leading to higher churn in fiber-optic users.
  4.Review Payment Methods
    Encourage customers using electronic checks to switch to auto-debit or credit card payments.
  5.Early-Stage Engagement
    Focus retention efforts on new customers within the first few months of service.

⭐ Customers to Prioritise
  The company should prioritize customers who meet multiple risk criteria:
    Month-to-month contract holders 
    High monthly charges 
    Short tenure
    Fiber-optic internet users 
    Electronic check payment users

These customers have the highest churn probability and should receive targeted retention offers.

🧠 Strategic Insight
   By combining machine learning predictions with business strategy, companies can move from reactive churn handling to proactive customer retention, improving revenue      stability and customer satisfaction.
